@article{Mikolov2013,
abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large num-ber of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alterna-tive to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of " Canada " and " Air " cannot be easily combined to obtain " Air Canada " . Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

@article{Ocallaghan,
abstract = {In recent years, topic modeling has become an established method in the analysis of text corpora, with probabilistic techniques such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) commonly employed for this purpose. However, it might be argued that enough attention is often not paid to the issue of topic coherence, the semantic interpretability of the top terms usually used to describe discovered topics. Nevertheless, a number of studies have proposed measures for analyzing such coherence, where these have been largely focused on topics found by LDA, with matrix decomposition techniques such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) being somewhat overlooked in comparison. This motivates the current work, where we compare and analyze topics found by popular variants of both NMF and LDA in multiple corpora in terms of both their coherence and associated generality, using a combination of existing and new measures, including a distributional semantics measure based on an algorithm provided by the increasingly popular word2vec tool. Two out of three coherence measures find NMF to regularly produce more coherent topics, with higher levels of generality and redundancy observed with the LDA topic descriptors. In all cases, it appears that the associated term weighting strategy plays a major role. The results observed with NMF suggest that this may be a more suitable topic modeling method when analyzing certain corpora, such as those associated with niche or non-mainstream domains.},
